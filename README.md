Vue.js & Quasar Cross-Platform Component Portfolio

🚀 Overview

A focused portfolio of reusable, cross-platform components built with Vue.js Composition API and the Quasar Framework. This repository demonstrates production-ready code emphasizing maintainability, performance, and testability, reflecting 7 years of full-lifecycle engineering experience.

✨ Demonstrated Technical Expertise

These files highlight specific skills that align with senior-level development roles:

Frontend Core: Vue.js 3 (Composition API), Advanced JavaScript (ES6+), Clean HTML/CSS

Cross-Platform: Quasar Framework, Responsive Design Principles, Component Reusability

State & Logic: Vue Router, Local Component State Management, Mixins/Composables

API Integration: RESTful API Consumption, CRUD Operations (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)

Code Quality: Modular Structure, Readability, Attention to Edge Cases (from QA experience)

📂 Code Showcase (File Breakdown)

Reviewing these specific files will demonstrate my approach to building scalable applications:

CustomDataTable.vue:
Demonstrates handling complex state (pagination, filtering, sorting) using the Composition API (setup).

Focuses on performance optimization for B2B applications.
AuthService.js:

Shows a clean, injectable service (Composable) for managing authentication tokens and secure REST API calls.
DynamicFormBuilder.vue:

Illustrates techniques for dynamic component rendering based on JSON schema, crucial for flexible application architecture.

🛠️ Setup & Running

This repository is designed for code review. These files are extracted from a standard Quasar CLI project.

Clone a base Quasar project.

Install dependencies: npm install

Place these files into the appropriate component directories and import them.

I welcome discussion on the structure and logic of these components.
